        <h1>My Shopping List</h1>
        <p>When I go shopping, I would like to buy some foods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>potatoes;</li>
            <li>carrots;</li>
            <li>vodka;</li>
            <li>pork.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>That's isn't it yet</h2>
        <p>Things I would like to <strong>prepare</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I <em>peel</em> potatoes.</li>
            <li>I <em>slice</em> carrots.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile I drink <strong><em>lots</em></strong> of vodka.</li>
            <li>Same time pork being baked.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That would be the nicest lunch, wouldn't it?</p>
